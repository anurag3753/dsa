# dsa problem solving template

- Read the Question
- Try the examples manually
- Identify edge cases
- Come-up with a brute force solution
	- Reason about its Time & Space Complexity
	- Code it
	- Run this by hand (on problem testcases + edge cases)
- Submit the brute force solution (Only failing scenario should be TLE)
- Look at the code for possible optimizations
- Repeat 4-5 and submit the optimized code.
