# Design Pattern

1. [[notes/6 - Main Notes/Strategy Design Pattern|Strategy Design Pattern]] : It is used whenever there are multiple algorithms/strategies to perform a particular task and which strategy to use is decided at the runtime. Basically, we encapsulate these strategies into separate classes and dynamically decide which one we want to use. **Example:** Different Sorting Algorithms
2. [[notes/6 - Main Notes/Observer Design Pattern|Observer Design Pattern]] : The **Observer** pattern is a software design pattern in which an object, called the **Subject** (**Observable**), manages a list of dependents, called **Observers**, and notifies them automatically of any internal state changes by calling one of their methods.
3. [[notes/6 - Main Notes/Decorator Design Pattern|Decorator Design Pattern]] : The **Decorator Design Pattern** allows you to add new functionality to objects dynamically by wrapping them with decorator classes, without altering their structure.
4. [Singleton Pattern](singleton_pattern.md)
5. [Factory Pattern](factory_pattern.md)
6.  [Adapter Pattern](adapter_pattern.md)
7. [Facade Pattern](facade_pattern.md)

8. [Command Pattern](command_pattern.md)

9. [Prototype Pattern](prototype_pattern.md)

10. [Builder Pattern](builder_pattern.md)
