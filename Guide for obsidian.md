Zettelkanten Workflow (6C's)

![[zettel_workflow.png]]

1. Great for Learning:
	1.1 Keeps it Slow (Forces you to take notes and write your ideas) (Speed & Reading are not a good mix)
		- It brings you focus. (Memory Boost)
		- Make More Sense (you understand deeply)
	1.2 Instant Feedback
		- To get better at anything you need two things. 1. Practice and 2. Feedback
		- Writing notes works like an instant feedback. You get an instant reflection of whether you understood the topic or not. If you struggle to put something in words, It means you do not understand it yet.
	1.3 Freedom to Connect
		- It creates a network of ideas. Where thoughts are free to connect with other notes.
2. Store and Mix Ideas:
	1. All your notes are in the same place. It gives the freedom to connect the ideas with one another to create the new ideas.
	2. We use a system of Tags and Hyperlinks to navigate the notes more effectively in later down the future.
3. Easier & Faster Writing
	1. You just read about whatever you are interested in and make notes. Later down the line you have enough content available with you. With just simple reorganization of your notes, voil√† (you got yourself an interesting article)
	2. If you just follow this system, you are building yourself a personal writing assistant. It only gets stronger with time.

- It is recommended to store the vault in the cloud(Google Drive too). (Or in GitHub too). So that you can access it whenever you want.

- Rough Notes:
	- Here, we put down anything temporary. Maybe (ideas I had, reminders, rough notes)
	- It is like a notepad where you just want to write down the things that you do not want to forget.

- Source Material:
	- Contains the various references which we used to write the notes.
- Tags:
	- We write the `double square bracket` to create a note. If it does not exists, it will be created. Then we can move this note to the `Tags` directory. Later we can just use this tag.
- Indexes:
	- Once the network of notes become really large, these indexes come to save us. Because the `tags`are just empty notes, we can use them as indexes too.
	- When a tag becomes big enough, meaning we have connected a lot of notes to it. You can actually turn a tag into an index. 
	- An index is almost like the contents page of a book. You take all the notes within the tag and give them some sort of logical structure. This is super easy, because all our tags are just empty notes. 
	- When we have a lot of notes connected to a `tag`, then it makes sense to create an `index` for it.
	- We have created a new note inside the `index` directory and created a lot of heading and subheading and mention the relevant notes in there. We can refer the video later. Because it will come into picture once our notes started to become bigger and bigger.
- Templates:
	- It is a one time job, create it and forget about it.

- Main Notes:
	- This is the main directory which contains all your notes.

Ideas:
- Once you create a `rough note`. Then you should create a `main note` for it. The idea here is to keep only the relevant information.
- After you are done with the `rough note` ask yourself, why does this topic even matter. What is the use case that it is solving.
- The idea here is, that in future you should be able to return to these notes and understand it immediately.
- `#baby`:- newly created note and badly written
- `#child` :- once we write more in the notes, and connect it to other notes. Then we can upgrade the note status to child
- `#adult` :- Fully matured note. Completely self-explanatory and also contain relevant references to other notes.
- You should write personal sentences inside the `main note` to connect the idea that you are reading more understandable to you.
- Keep the notes `short`. A note should never be skipping the window size of the laptop. Meaning, you should be able to see the note from `start` to `finish`.
- Tackle one idea at a time. Do not end up connecting too many ideas in a note.
- If you want to expand on an idea, may be created a new note and then connect both notes using the hyperlink.
- Format your notes, so that you feel it easy to understand the next time you visit your notes.
- In references section, keep hyperlinks to any of the notes which discusses the similar idea. Also, you can put the references to the source material from which the idea actually originated.


### Tag Creation Advice
- DO NOT Create a `tag` too generic OR too specific. Whenever you feel the need to create a `new tag` always ask this question to yourself, whether you will ever need to use this `tag` again in the future. That is whether, I will again come across a note which will share the same tag.
- Sometimes, you can just refer to the notes similar to the one you are currently writing. And look at their tags to understand if either of those tags you can re-use instead of creating the new ones.
- You should not put more than 5 tags in any note. 


Commands:
- Press `Ctrl+O` to create a new note. Type the title of the note and press `Enter`. The good part here is, when you type in something, and you have a related note already created. It will pop up.
	- If you already have an existing note, maybe you can elaborate it with the new-found information.
